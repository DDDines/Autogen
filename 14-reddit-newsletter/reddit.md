## Let OpenAI know in the Unsubscribe survey, that Claude 3 Opus is taking the lead!

Have been using both in parallel for over a week now and I naturally started not opening ChatGPT anymore, but only using Opus 3 - It's actually crazy how much better it is, if you use it for a while and go back. 

If you come to the same conclusion and cancel your subscription as well, let them know in the survey and let's hope, they hurry up with their next model release!

## 100% AI-generated Podcast by GPT and Claude

I wrote a program to have Claude and GPT chat with each other - 100% AI-generated podcast - the result is fascinating!

Here is an unedited podcast between a female painter (Claude Sonnet) and a male musician (GPT 3.5 turbo): [Link](https://soundcloud.com/yummymushroom/music-and-painting-ai-podcast)

I also generated a Chinese version (same personas but the conversations are totally different) - this version is even better - the artists talked about how other forms of art inspired them such as dancing and they even discussed how to collaborate and started brainstorming! The TTS for the Chinese version is not as natural as the English version but still quite awesome. The content is actually interesting.

Enjoy!
